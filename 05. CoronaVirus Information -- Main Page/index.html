        <h2 class="h1-primary">What to do to keep yourself and others safe from COVID-19</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Maintain at least a 1-metre distance between yourself and others to reduce your risk of infection when they cough, sneeze or speak. Maintain an even greater distance between yourself and others when indoors. The further away, the better.</li>
            
            <li>Make wearing a mask a normal part of being around other people. The appropriate use, storage and cleaning or disposal are essential to make masks as effective as possible.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="h1-primary">How to make your environment safer</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Avoid the 3Cs: spaces that are closed, crowded or involve close contact.</li>
            <li>Meet people outside.</li>
            <li>Avoid crowded or indoor settings </li>
            <li>Wear a mask</li>

        <h2 class="h1-primary">Don’t forget the basics of good hygiene</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. This eliminates germs including viruses that may be on your hands.</li>

            <li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth. Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and infect you.</li>

            <li>Cover your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately into a closed bin and wash your hands. By following good ‘respiratory hygiene’, you protect the people around you from viruses, which cause colds, flu and COVID-19.</li>

            <li> Clean and disinfect surfaces frequently especially those which are regularly touched, such as door handles, faucets and phone screens.</li>
